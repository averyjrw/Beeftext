I'm having an issue with Beeftext and want to report it. 
Sorry if this is the wrong way about reporting an issue, but this is the only way I could figure out how to share details about this issue. 

In summary, Beeftext appears to be copying data from my clipboard occassionally, INSTEAD of putting in the snippet, it's pasting in whatever happens to be in my clipboard at the time. 
Definitlely some sort of glitch. See screen recording of the issue presenting itself below.
